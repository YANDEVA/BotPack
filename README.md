Go to your config.json and set it in the language property:
```json
{
  "language": "en",
}
```

  <summary>Appstate Encryption</summary>
  
  ### Security 
  Are you having an issue about getting your account stolen or hacked? This might due to your appstate provided which is stolen by other users. If you feel unsecure, try setting up *"encryptSt"* to *true* in the **config.json**.
  
  ```json
  {
    "encrpytSt": true
  }
  ```

  Encrypting won't affect the bot process and will only make the appstate harder to be used by thiefs and hackers. Furthermore, it may get laggy when opening the appstate.json after being encrypted but still it is worth a shot.
